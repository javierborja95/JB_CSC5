The rules of this game are simple.
Guess the 4 digit combination of the Ai in under 10 turns.
First, type in a 4 digit combination. Numbers 1-8, no duplicates.
Next, the computer will tell you how you are doing.
It will output a potentially 4 character string.
X's = correct number and position.
O's = correct number and incorrect position.
If you can not guess the computer's combination in ten turns, you lose.
