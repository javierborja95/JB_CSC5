The rules of this game are simple.
Guess the Ai's 4 digit combination in 10 turns.
First, type in your 4 digit combination. Numbers 1-8, no duplicates.
Next, the computer will tell you how you are doing.
X's = correct number and position.
O's = correct number but incorrect position.
If you don't guess a correct number you will go straight to the next turn.
If you can't guess the computer's combination in 10 turns, you lose.
Good Luck!
