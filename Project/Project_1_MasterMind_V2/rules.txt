The rules of this game are simple.
Guess a 4 digit combination of the Ai in 10 turns.
First, type in your 4 digit combination. Numbers 1-8, no duplicates.
Next, the computer will tell you how you are doing.
X's = correct number and position.
O's = correct number but incorrect position.
If you don't guess any correct number you will go straight to the next turn.
If you can not guess the computer's combination in ten turns, you lose.
Good Luck!
