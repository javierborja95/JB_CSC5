Normal Mode:
Guess the Ai's 4 digit code in 8 turns.
First, type in your 4 digit combination. Numbers 1-8, no duplicates.
Next, the computer will tell you how you are doing.
X's = correct number and position.
O's = correct number but incorrect position.
If you don't guess a correct number you will go straight to the next turn.
If you can't guess the computer's combination in 8 turns, you lose.

Hard Mode:
The Ai may choose duplicate numbers!
But you have up to 12 turns to guess the code.
To make it worth your while, you will get 2 wins for winning.

Hints:
If you feel stuck, type in 4 zeros(0000) to get a hint.
You will get all 4 digits of the combination, least to greatest,
but you still have to guess their position.
This will not count as a win on the leaderboard.
But you can still lose, so be careful!

Good Luck!
